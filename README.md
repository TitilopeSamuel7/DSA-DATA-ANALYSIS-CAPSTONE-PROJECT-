## 🚀 Introduction
This is the **Digital Skill Up Africa* (DSA) Data Analysis Capstone Project**.  
After about two months of intensive learning and evaluations while working with **Excel, SQL, and Power BI**, I have built robust analytical skills.

This repository focuses on the **SQL case study** component.

---

## 📝 Project Topic
**Kultra Megastores (KMS)** Inventory & Sales Analysis using SQL.

---

## 🔍 Project Overview
This project analyzes the **Kultra Megastores (KMS)** inventory data using SQL to uncover key insights on **sales, shipping patterns, customer behavior, and profitability** from **2009 to 2012**.

The goal is to help KMS make **informed business decisions** that optimize revenue, control costs, and enhance customer engagement.

---

## 📂 Data Source
I sourced the data from the **DSA Learning Management System via Canva**, consisting of two main files:

- `KMS SQL Case Study`
- `Order Status`

These contain detailed records of transactions, customer segments, product categories, sales values, discounts, shipping methods, and return data.

---

## 🗂️ Case Scenarios Overview
There are two primary areas of analysis:

### 📊 Case Scenario 1: Sales & Profitability Analysis
Aims to help KMS understand **what drives revenue and costs**, and where there are opportunities to improve profitability.

### 👥 Case Scenario 2: Customer Behavior & Returns Analysis
Focuses on:
- Tailoring marketing & sales strategies to top customers.
- Reducing losses from returns by knowing **who returns items and from where**.
- Optimizing shipping to save costs without delaying deliveries.

## 🗂️ Case Scenarios

---

### Case Scenario 1: Sales & Profitability Analysis

#### Question 1
**Which product category had the highest sales?**

- ✅ **SQL Query:**
    ```[see]
    -- (KMS_case_study.sql)
    ```

- ✅ **Evaluation:**  
    The analysis revealed that **Technology** is the highest-grossing product category.  
    This suggests strong customer demand and possibly higher margins in this segment.

- 🔍 **Recommendation:**  
    KMS should continue investing in technology products, consider expanding the range, and use targeted campaigns to further capitalize on this strength.

---

#### Question 2
**What are the top 3 and bottom 3 regions in terms of sales?**

- ✅ **SQL Query:**
    ``[`see]
    --(KMS_case_study.sql)
    ```

- ✅ **Evaluation:**  
    - **Top 3 regions:** West, Ontario, Prince  
    - **Bottom 3 regions:** Nunavut, Northwest Territories, Yukon

    This indicates clear regional differences in purchasing behavior.

- 🔍 **Recommendation:**  
    KMS should focus promotional resources on high-performing regions while exploring why sales lag in the bottom regions—whether due to logistics, lack of demand, or inadequate marketing.

---

#### Question 3
**What were the total sales of appliances in Ontario?**

- ✅ **SQL Query:**
    ```[see]
    ---(KMS_case_study.sql)
    ```

- ✅ **Evaluation:**  
    The query returned `NULL`, meaning there were **no recorded sales of appliances in Ontario**.  
    This may indicate either:
    - Appliances were **not stocked or promoted** in Ontario during the period.
    - Or there is **low consumer demand for appliances** in this region.

- 🔍 **Recommendation:**  
    KMS should investigate customer preferences in Ontario or consider a test marketing campaign for appliances to assess potential demand.

---

#### Question 4
**Advise the management of KMS on what to do to increase revenue from the bottom 10 customers.**

- ✅ **SQL Query:**
    ```[see]
    -- (KMS_case_study.sql)
    ```

- ✅ **Evaluation:**  
    The bottom 10 customers contribute minimally to overall revenue.

- 🔍 **Recommendation:**  
    - Offer **personalized promotions**, e.g., “Spend ₦20,000, get 10% off,” to encourage larger purchases.
    - Provide **targeted product recommendations** based on purchase history.
    - Use **customer satisfaction surveys** to identify obstacles to spending more.  
    This could help convert them into higher-value customers.

---

#### Question 5
**KMS incurred the most shipping costs using which shipping method?**

- ✅ **SQL Query:**
    ```[see]
    -- (KMS_case_study.sql)
    ```

- ✅ **Evaluation:**  
( KMS incurred the most shipping cost using Express Air ) *

---

### Case Scenario 2: Customer Behavior & Returns Analysis

#### Question 6
**Who are the most valuable customers and what products do they typically purchase?**

- ✅ **SQL Query:**
    ```[see]
    --(KMS_case_study.sql)
    ```

---

#### Question 7
**Which small business customer had the highest sales?**

- ✅ **SQL Query:**
    ```[see]
    --(KMS_case_study.sql)
    `

---

#### Question 8
**Which corporate customer placed the most number of orders in 2009-2012?**

- ✅ **SQL Query:**
    ```[see](KMS_case_study.sql)
    ```

---

#### Question 9
**Which consumer customer was the most profitable one?**

- ✅ **SQL Query:**
    ```[see](KMS_case_study)
    ``

---

#### Question 10
**Which consumer returned items and what segment did they belong to?**

- ✅ **SQL Query:**
    ``[see](KMS_case_study)
    ``

---

#### Question 11
**Is KMS appropriately spending on shipping based on order priority?*
    ```

- ✅ **Evaluation**
-Express Air is used for high-priority orders and cheaper method (truck) for less urgent ones.

## 🛠️ Tools Used
- **SQL Server Management Studio (SSMS)** applying:
    - Data Definition Language (DDL)
    - Data Query Language (DQL)
    - `GROUP BY`, `ORDER BY`, `BETWEEN`, `IN`
    - SQL `JOIN`
    - Aggregations like `SUM`, `COUNT`
    - `UNION ALL`
